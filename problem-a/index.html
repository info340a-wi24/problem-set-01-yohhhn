            <p> <a href="https://brooklyn99.fandom.com/wiki/Raymond_Holt">Raymond Holt</a>, played by Andre Braugher, is the 
                captain of the fictional 99th precinct in the show Brooklyn 99. As a gay, black police officer, 
                he has faced much discrimination, shaping much of his no-nonsense attitude and strict adherence to rules. 
                However, throughout the show he learns to act less like a robot thanks to his squad.
